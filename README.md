# Mitchell Konkel - Portfolio

## Decsription

The purpose of this project was to create a portoflio to house the different projects that I will create throughout the bootcamp. As it is now, the site is a template that is intended to be updated and improved upon as I progress through the bootcamp. This was also an important project for the bootcamp because it was the first assignment where we had to build and entire site from scratch.
